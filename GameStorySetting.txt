The game's story takes place in a semi-futuristic world. It's something like a mix between the wild west and tech.
The main antagonistic force is a big, technologically advanced company that has a monopoly on the military.
They have too much power to be stopped and are taking over the world.
The story starts where the MC's small town is, right before an invasion from the company begins.
